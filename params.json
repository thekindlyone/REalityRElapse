{"google":"","tagline":"Anime downloader","name":"Realityrelapse","body":"![screenshot](http://i739.photobucket.com/albums/xx38/dodo_dodder/screenlapse.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tool downloads anime episodes sequentially from www.realitylapse.com\r\n\r\nfile list:\r\n\r\n1. REalityRElapsegui.pyw - Source with tkinter gui\r\n\r\n2. REalityRElapse_x64.7z - windows x64 binary. Unzip and run exe\r\n\r\n3. REalityRElapse_win32.7z- win32 binare. Unzip and run exe\r\n\r\n4. REalityRElapse.py - Command line version\r\n\r\n5. README - this file\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n1. Free Download Manager available at http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n1.Fill the form. Anime name should be as it appears in www.realitylapse.com use the presets for some pointers\r\n\r\n2.set download directory and make sure that freedownload manager downloads by default to that directory. Set this via free download managers settings.\r\n\r\n3.under advanced settings of free download manager settings new downloads tab, set partial/incomplete downloads to have either extra extension(.incmpl or something) or to have partial dloads hidden(extension method recommended )\r\n\r\n4.Set range of downloads. only integers in these entry boxes. don't add padding 0s\r\n\r\nThats about it. \r\n\r\nNote: there is very little error detection in this app. So fill the form correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Note: realitylapse.com is a great site. But to freely download anime episodes, you cant just queue them up in a download manager. It changes the urls every ~30 mins and if you queue up say 10 episodes for download(after going through the whole repeated clicking,waiting process) you'll find that the links all expired after 3 completed downloads. This script was written to work around that very problem. \r\n\r\nRegarding doubts about the script mail me at dodo.dodder@gmail.com   ","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
